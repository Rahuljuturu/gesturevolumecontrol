##Hand Volume Control using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project demonstrates a simple application that uses hand gestures to control the system volume. The application uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to detect hand landmarks and calculate the distance between the thumb and index finger tips. This distance is then used to interpolate the volume level, which is set using AppleScript on macOS.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- AppleScript (for volume control on macOS)
